# Trunk-Based Development Demo

This is an example repository demonstrating PipeCraft's trunk-based development workflow.

## About This Demo

This repository showcases how PipeCraft automates:

- **Branch Flow Management**: develop → staging → main
- **Automatic Versioning**: Semantic versioning based on conventional commits
- **Change Detection**: Domain-specific testing and deployment
- **Pull Request Automation**: Auto-creation and merging of promotion PRs
